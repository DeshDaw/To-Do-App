To Do App
This To Do App was created as a personal project to explore the various paths available to me as a Computer Science student pursuing my bachelor's degree. It is a simple yet meaningful app and marks my first step into app development.

Features
Add tasks to a list.
View the tasks in real time.
Delete completed tasks.

ðŸš¨ Note About Storage
The app does not have persistent storage. This means:

Tasks are stored in memory while the app is running.
If the app is closed, all tasks will be lost.
To avoid losing your tasks, keep the app running in the background.

Purpose

This project helped me get hands-on experience with coding, debugging, and understanding the basics of app development. While simple, it represents the beginning of my journey in app development.
